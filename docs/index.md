Flex Launcher is a customizable application launcher designed with a [10 foot user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-foot_user_interface). Its intended purpose is to simplify the control of a home theater or couch gaming PC by providing an interface that is similar to a TV set-top box or game console. Flex Launcher allows you to launch applications on your living room PC entirely by use of a TV remote or a gamepad. No keyboard or mouse required!

Flex Launcher is compatible with both Windows and Linux (including Raspberry Pi devices).

## About
Flex Launcher was initially released in 2021. Its creation was motivated by the puzzling lack of HTPC control options at the time. Flex Launcher is designed with the following principles in mind:
- **Flexibility:** Indicated in the name *Flex* Launcher, the configuration should be highly flexible, with user having a great deal of control over the appearance and behavior of the program.
- **Simplicity:** The interface should be simple, yet beautiful.
- **Portability:** Many of the other existing solutions only support a single platform. Flex Launcher aims to be portable and cross-platform, running on ARM-based SBCs such as Raspberry Pi, to high-end Windows PCs, and everything in between.
- **Ease of Navigation:** Flex Launcher should be completely navigable using only directional keys, enter, and back. The launcher should include built-in support for gamepad devices.
